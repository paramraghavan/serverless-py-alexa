 #So when it comes to beta testing your skills, 
 the primary engine to do this is going to be email 
 invitationâ€‘driven. So, we're going to be going into 
 the developer console, and I'll show you exactly how 
 to perform this, and you're going to be entering in 
 those email addresses for those individuals that you 
 want to help beta test your skill. Ideally, you would
 be speaking to these individuals and you would be 
 obtaining an email address, that is the email address 
 that they have registered at amazon.com and that they 
 have registered their Alexa devices with. That makes 
 it totally seamless.

# Beta testers:
 500 invites per skill
 Must have Alexa device
 And Amazon account
 
#Pre-certification
HIPPA eligible checklist

#Invocation names are fixed 
once a skill has been published(once u put it into to the store with other skill
invocation name cannot be changed), because u do not want to confuse the user
